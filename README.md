# sql-server-client-docs
A repository to track the internals of how a SQL Server client works.

The details on this site have been prepared during the course of my work on Sql Client, the .Net Driver for SQL server.

The documentation here is my understanding of how the client is implemented and its association with ADO.Net and the TDS protocol, for SQL Server.

This site is not backed / funded by Microsoft. 

The motivation to create this site, is to add some clarity around the working of the SQL server client, which might be helpful to any OSS developer. 

# Contributions are welcome

TBD: A contribution guide is needed for this repository.
